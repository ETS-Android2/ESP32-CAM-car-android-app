After you connect to that network, you must open the application on your device.

If after 10 seconds you do not see this WIFI access point, it is possible that the vehicle is already linked to a WIFI network.

### The application:

When you open the application, the first thing you will see is a user guide in Spanish or English, the language will change depending on the language configured on your device.

This guide provides quick help to get started with the application. Press the button at the end of the guide to go to the vehicle control screen.

The first thing the application will do is search for the vehicle on the network, whether it is connected to the WIFI of your home or the WIFI of the vehicle, the application will go through the range of IPs until it finds the correct one.

When the application recognizes the vehicle's IP, it is enabled to control it, the control view is as follows:
